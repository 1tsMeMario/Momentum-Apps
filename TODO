Core improvements
=================

- More protocols, especially TPMS.
- CC1101 synchronous mode with protocol hopping?
- Protocols decoded can register actions, for instance to generate
  sub files with modified signal and so forth.
- Optimize memory usage storing raw samples in a bitfield: 15 bits
  duration, 1 bit level.
- Implement checksum for all TPMS protocols. They have very weak
  preamble/sync discrimination.
