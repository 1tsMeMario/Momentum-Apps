Core improvements
=================

- Remove processing from rendering callback, put it into timer.
- Detection of non Manchester and non RZ encoded signals. Not sure if there are any signals that are not self clocked widely used in RF.

Features
========

- In raw visualization mode, up/down change scaling (100,200,...,500us per pixel)
- Pressing right/left you browse different modes:
  * Current best signal pulse classes.
  * Raw square wave display. Central button freezes and resumes (toggle). When frozen we display "paused" (inverted) on the low part of the screen.
- Setup of frequency, AM/FM, ... done with single screens (for each function) found on the right, so that when you are on that screen up/down has the effect of changing frequency / mode.

Screens sequence (user can navigate with <- and ->):


                            (default)
[modulation] <> [freq] <> [pulses view] <> [raw square view] <> [signal info]
