# FlipperZero_NFC_Playlist

The idea behind this app is to allow for you to test multiple copies of NFC's at once as a bulk test

At the moment this project is very basic and just reads the cards from the txt file and emulates the NFC's but this is very early days of development and i wanted to make a basic version of my idea first

## How it works (As of the moment will change):
At the moment it reads the files and in what order from a txt file in the apps_data folder called playlist.txt an example of the file can be found in the repository

## Branch changes

In this branch i will be adding the ability to cancel the playlist while it runs along with other emulation based improvments

## TODO:

- [x] Add basic UI
- [ ] Add the ability to adjust time between cards
- [ ] Add the ability to adjust card queue from within the app
- [ ] Make it so you can pause, stop and continue the running of the cards
