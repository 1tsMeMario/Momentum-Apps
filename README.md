## What is it?

Flipper Authenticator is a software-based authenticator that implements two-step verification services using the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP; specified in RFC 6238) and HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm.
It is like [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), but for [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) device.

## How to get it?

If you don't want to build the app yourself then just pull FAP file from [latest release](https://github.com/akopachov/flipper-zero_authenticator/releases) and put it to your Flipper Zero device by copying it to `/ext/apps/Misc`. After that you should be able to run it on your Flipper.

## How to build it?

Just pull the repo with recursive submodule initialization and then run `./build.ps1` command to build the app. Once done FAP files will be available in the `build` directory.
