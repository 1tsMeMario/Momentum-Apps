# flizzer_tracker
 A Flipper Zero chiptune tracker.

CURRENT STATE: proof of concept. Works only on custom build of the firmware (tiny font not supported yet), you can't edit instruments; effects, vibrato and PWM are not implemented, as well as a lot of other things (saving/loading module, song loop points, instrument klystrack-like program, instrument editor, instrument/song name editing etc.)
