# flizzer_tracker
 A Flipper Zero chiptune tracker.

CURRENT STATE: proof of concept+++. Works only on custom build of the firmware (tiny font not supported yet); effects are not implemented, as well as a lot of other things (song loop points, instrument klystrack-like program (you can edit it but it does not work), etc.). After brief testing looks like it saves and loads modules properly tho.
