This is an implementation of the classic Asteroids game for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). Inside you will find a simple 2D engine that can be reused to implement other games.

Controls:
* Left/Right: rotate ship in the two directions.
* Ok, short press: fire bullets.
* Ok, long press: accelerate towards ship head.
* Down: decelerates.

This is a screenshot, but the game looks a lot better in the device itself:
