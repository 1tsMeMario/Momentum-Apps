# FlipperZeroBrainfuck

A brainfuck editor and interpreter for the flipper zero.  
Allows for the opening and execution of .b files.  

Very much a WIP, currently only the editor half is complete.  
.b files are currently limited in lenght but im planning to remove this limitation when i learn more about how the F0 handles file reading/writing.
