# FlipperZero_NFC_Playlist

The idea behind this app is to allow for you to test multiple copies of NFC's at once as a bulk test

At the moment this project is very basic and just reads the cards from the txt file and runs the emulating but this is vert early days of development and i wanted to make a basic version of my idea first

## How it works (As of the moment will change):
At the moment it reads the files and in what order from a txt file in the apps_data folder called playlist.txt and example can be found in the repository

## TODO:

- [ ] Add basic UI
- [ ] Add the ability to adjust time between cards
- [ ] Add the ability to adjust card queue from within the app
- [ ] Make it so you can pause, stop and continue the running of the cards
